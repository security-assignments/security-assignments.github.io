# Complete this very gentle introduction to Linux Terminal

CodeAcademy has an [introductory set of lessons](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) that teach the Linux Terminal. 
You should complete the first lesson-set within each module:

1. Navigating the File System

2. Viewing and Changing the File System
    1. [Manipulation](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/manipulation/resume)
3. Redirecting Input and Output
    1. [Redirection](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/redirection/resume)
4. Configuring the Environment
    1. [Environment](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/environment/resume)

You do _not_ need to do any of the "projects" or multiple choice quizzes. Just the lesson-sets.
    

    
    
# Learn a linux text editor

The CodeAcademy lessons above give you basic exposure to the `nano` text editor. However, you are free to use whatever text editor you like. `nano` is good for beginners, though.



# Deliverable

You _must use your Kali vm for the following_. Doing so proves both that you got Kali up and running, and that you have basic skills with Linux terminal.

* Make a directory called `le-tutorial`
* In that directory, create a file called `i-did-it.txt` with the following contents: `Hello, world!`
* Submit a screenshot showing:
    * The contents of that file (`cat`)
    * A string with your name and uni email, e.g., `echo "David Eargle david.eargle@colorado.edu"`
    * Run the `date` command
    
For example:
