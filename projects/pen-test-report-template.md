This page provides a template for a penetration test vulnerability assessment
report. The rubric for each section can be found on the [assignment description
page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/pen-test.md %}#rubric).

Remove all colored blocks from your final submission.

Throughout the document, replace the following placeholder values with the appropriate value:

- `{team_identifier}` -- Your class team identifier. For example, "Team 1".
- `{acquisition_target}` -- The name of the company for your assessment
- `{link_provided_by_instructor}`  -- The asset link provided to you by your instructor

This report is confidential; you are forbidden to share it publicly, or to post it on a site such as LinkedIn or your resume website.

# {team_identifier} Penetration Testing Report

{: .alert .alert-warning }
_[List team member names here]_

# Executive Summary

{: .alert .alert-warning }
_One-page executive summary that highlights the
most important findings of your report._

---

{: .instructions }
> Must be no longer than one page. This should be written so that
> non-technical executives can understand.
>
> Describe the number of serious successful
> exploits and the amount of sensitive data you were
> able to obtain.
>
> Give a high-level summary of your recommendations
> to fix the problem.
>
> Don’t describe specifics or use technical terms
> that may be unfamiliar to a non-technical person in
> this section.

# 1.	Project Scope Description

{: .alert .alert-warning }
_Description of the scope of the project, objectives, and your authorization to perform the assessment_

---

{: .instructions }
> Includes identifying information for the asset under attack, and dates and
> times that you are given permission to attempt to access it.
>
> This should be written so that non-technical executives can understand.

## 1.1.	Objectives

{: .alert .alert-warning }
_The agreement objectives. Use the below text, copied from the assignment description._

{acquisition_target} and {team_identifier} hereby enter into a contractual
agreement for {team_identifier} to carry out a vulnerability assessment of a specific
{acquisition_target} asset described below.

The specific {acquisition_target} asset was accessible at the time of the assessment from link {link_provided_by_instructor}.

## Objectives

{team_identifier}'s objectives are threefold:

1.    Document vulnerabilities that {team_identifier} is able to successfully exploit on the
      server. Describe in detail what was done and what level of access {team_identifier} was obtained. 
      If {team_identifier} obtains a user account with limited privileges, document
      whether it was possible to escalate the privileges to root. Document each
      exploit that was successfully launched.

2.    Document potentially sensitive information that {team_identifier} was able to obtain from
      the server. These could include user files or web, database, or other server
      files.

3.    For both 1 and 2 above, argue for methods that could protect the
      vulnerabilities and sensitive information from > exploitation.

## 1.2.	Authorization

{: .alert .alert-warning }
_A copy of your authorization to perform the threat assessment.

{team_identifier} operatied under the following authorization:

> ## Authorization
>
> {team_identifier} is hereby authorized to perform the agreed-upon vulnerability assessment
> of the {acquisition_target} vagrantbox virtual machine with IP address 192.168.56.200.
> The scope of engagement is exclusively limited to the single {acquisition_target} asset.
>
> {team_identifier} may:
>
> * Access the server through any technological means available.
> * Carry out activities that may crash the server.
>
> {team_identifier} may not:
>
> * Social engineer any {acquisition_target} employees.
> * Sabotage the work of any other consultancy team hired by {acquisition_target}.
> * Disclose to any other party any information discovered on the asset.
>
> Furthermore, note the following:
>
> * The asset is a vagrantbox development version of a live asset. The
>   vagrant-standard privileged user `vagrant` is present on this virtual
>   machine, but not on the live version of the asset. Therefore, any access via
>   the `vagrant` user is moot and is out of scope.


# 2.	Target of Assessment

{: .alert .alert-warning }
_Information about the server examined (i.e., OS, user accounts, applications installed, databases stored)._

---

{: .instructions }
> Give a brief description of noteworthy applications installed, web sites hosted, services running, and
> databases that exist (both database applications, such as MySQL, and information stored within those database
> applications).

_High-level description of vulnerabilities successfully exploited and sensitive data obtained._

> list them in an appendix. If you obtain passwords, list what those passwords are._
>
> Include table entries for each exploit and sensitive data obtained.
> Give a brief 1–4 sentence overview of what you were able to accomplish. Then include a cross-reference to a subsection in
