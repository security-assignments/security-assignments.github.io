comment: In _Spam Nation_, investigative journalist Brian Krebs unmasks the
     criminal masterminds driving some of the biggest spam and hacker
     operations targeting Americans and their bank accounts. Tracing the
     rise, fall, and alarming resurrection of the digital mafia behind the two

     spyware attacks-he delivers the first definitive narrative of the global
     spam problem and its threat to consumers everywhere.
