In this lab, you will examine and run live malware called WannaCry.

# Overview

If an organization gets hit by malware, upper management all the way to the top
will want to know exactly what happened. Basic malware analysis can provide
answers for upper management. If you are in a management position, you may want
to know answers to questions that approaches in this lab can help answer.

In this lab, you’ll examine the malware WannaCry. This program made
international headlines in the summer of 2017 when it [wreaked havoc across the
world](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/world/europe/uk-national-health-service-cyberattack.html)
before being disabled by malware analyst
[Marcus](https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-marcus-hutchins-hacker-who-saved-the-internet/)
[Hutchins](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/03/marcus-hutchins-hacker.html),
aka [MalwareTech](https://www.malwaretech.com).

WannaCry is ransomware that encrypts the victim’s files and demands ransom in
order to decrypt. But due to a programming error, WannaCry does not decrypt
victim’s files even after the ransom is paid.


# Safety considerations

For this lab, you will examine WannaCry within the Windows VM running inside your Kali Linux virtual machine that is not susceptible to WannaCry. <span class="badge badge-danger">Heads up!</span> <strong>Therefore, your personal computer will not be at risk of being encrypted by WannaCry as long as you don't download and run WannaCry on it.</strong>

<span class="badge badge-danger">Important:</span> Do not copy WannaCry from the Windows VM to your personal computer. Do everything from Kali and from the Windows VM on Kali.

Below are a list of safety-related questions.


## Q: How does WannaCry spread?

This version of WannaCry uses the [EternalBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue) exploit to spread. Eternal Blue was developed by the NSA, and stolen and leaked by the [Shadow Brokers](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/us/nsa-shadow-brokers.html), and
subsequently picked up by [North Korean agents](https://kr.usembassy.gov/121917-press-briefing-attribution-wannacry-malware-attack-north-korea/) and used in WannaCry. Microsoft issued a patch for EternalBlue in March 2017.


## Q: I run Windows. Am I protected from the WannaCry's spreader, "EternalBlue"?

Yes, if you have updated your computer since 2017, you are protected from EternalBlue.


## Q: I'm patched against EternalBlue. Can I safely run WannaCry directly on my computer?

No. If you manually copy Wannacry to your computer, you have yourself fulfilled
the purpose of the EternalBlue spreader.

However, because WannaCry has a built-in killswitch, you still would not be
infected as long as you had an internet connection, as you will learn in the
lab.

But if you extracted the WannaCry encryptor from the dropper and manually
ran it on your computer, you would have bypassed the killswitch. Your files
would be encrypted, regardless of your internet connectivity. But it is
_extremely_ unlikely that you do this by accident.


## Q: Can my personal computer be infected via its remote desktop connection to Kali?

No. Wannacry cannot travel over the remote desktop protocol.


## Q: What machines could theoretically be compromised by the EternalBlue spreader running on GCP Kali?

**Short answer:** Other machines on the same virtual network as the Windows VM, and machines on the public internet, are potentially vulnerable to the EternalBlue spreader when it runs from the Windows VM. But neither of these are a concern for this lab.

**Longer answer:**
It is theoretically possible for WannaCry to spread to other machines if two conditions are met:
1. The victim virtual machine has a network adapter that gives it access to other machines on a network,
2. The other machines on that network are not patched against WannaCry's spreading mechanism.

<span class="badge badge-danger">Pay attention! Read the below!</span>

In this lab, you run WannaCry within a virtual machine running on Kali on GCP.
The malware has network connectivity to other machines on the network of the
compromised host. However, from the perspective of the windows vm running on Kali,
**the only other devices on the same "network" as the virtual machine** are:

1. **The other kali virtual machines.** But these are not vulnerable to WannaCry.
2. **Other machines on the public internet.** But if these
   are vulnerable to WannaCry, they have already been compromised a billion
   times over since 2017.

**Your personal laptop is _not_ on the same network as the Kali windows virtual
machine. The malware _cannot_ jump the Chrome Remote Desktop connection.**


## Safety tl;dr

As long as you only run the malware on the windows virtual machine running on
Kali, you are safe.


# Preparation and Recovery

For convenience, take a snapshot of your windows vm before you infect it with wannacry.

<div class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Heads up!</strong> Make sure that you have taken a snapshot of your Windows VM before proceeding. Having one will let you undo the messed-up state after you run the malware.
See <a class='alert-link' href='{{'/labs/virtual-machines#using-snapshots' | relative_url }}'>here</a> for how to create and use snapshots with <code>virt-manager</code>.</div>

If you forget to take a snapshot and you want to undo damage to your virtual
machine, you can restore your Windows VM to a pristine state by running the
following commands on Kali:

```bash
cd /root/vagrant-boxes/lab-windows-2019-vuln
vagrant destroy
vagrant up
```


# Preliminary Analysis

<span class="badge badge-danger">Heads up!</span> **Perform all of the following commands from within the Windows VM on Kali.**

1.  **From your Windows VM within Kali**, download the worm + loader executable from [here](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/05/18/index2.html) (look for the `24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe.zip` link).

1.  Extract the malware by right-clicking the folder, choosing `Extract all...`,
    and entering the password: "`infected`". This will create a new folder called "24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe.zip", inside of which is a `24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe` file.
    <span class='label lable-danger'>Do not run this file yet!</span>

    <span class='label label-info'>This is the dropper and spreader only.</span> Technically, it performs no encryption.

    * **Dropper:**

      > "[A dropper] is a special type of [malware]. Droppers carry payload to the
      victim system within itself. Payload is frequently compressed and encrypted
      or obfuscated. Once executed, a dropper extracts the payload from [itself]
      and installs it on a victim system (i.e., drops it on the system–which
      explains the term used for this type of infector). Unlike droppers,
      downloaders – another type of infector–doesn’t carry payload within itself
      but rather downloads it from a remote server"
      >
      >([*Rootkits and Bootkits*](https://nostarch.com/rootkits), Matrosov et al. 2019; p. 13).

      Wannacry is a dropper -- the encryptor is stashed inside of the just-extracted exe.
      The job of the wannacry dropper is to drop the encryptor on the victim host, and run it.

    * **Spreader:**

      A spreader is a malware component that spreads the malware to other
      computers on a network. In the case of Wannacry, it scans the network and
      infects as many other machines as it can. The dropper and spreader are the
      same file.

1.  Navigate to the _extracted_
    `24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe`
    folder (not the zipped one), and open a cmd prompt in that path by
    _holding down the shift key_ + right-clicking, then selecting "Open PowerShell window
    here."

    {% include lab-image.html image='wannacry-dir-navigate-not-zipped.PNG' %}
    {% include lab-image.html image='windows-right-click-cmd-path.jpg' %}

1.  Hash the exe using the following commands (use tab-completion for the exe filename).

    * SHA-256 (the default algorithm for the "get-filehash" command):

      ```bash
      get-filehash ./24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe
      ```

    * MD5:

      ```bash
      get-filehash -algorithm MD5 ./24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe
      ```

1.  Using a browser within the Windows VM, search the internet for the hashes to
    see what comes up. (You can copy them to the clipboard from a cmd prompt by
    highlighting them and then right-clicking the highlighted text.)
1.  Go to <https://VirusTotal.com> and search for either of the hashes.

    VirusTotal can run files and URLs through a barrage of antivirus
    programs to detect malicious files. This can be much more effective than
    checking a file against only one or two detection programs. However, people
    who create viruses also use this site to see whether their malicious code
    flags, and tweak the code until it comes up clean. It is not uncommon for a
    piece of malware to only turn up a few hits in VirusTotal.

    {% include lab_question.html question='What does Ad-Aware report this hash to be?' %}

1.  Visit <https://hybrid-analysis.com>, and search for the hash.
    Hybrid-analysis will check the hash of the file against previously analyzed
    files.

    Hybrid-Analysis provides "Falcon Reports," which are analyses of executing
    malware within certain operating system environments. The search results show a list of reports. The results also show "quickscan" results, which are themselves a collection of sandbox reports for a given sample.

    1.  Select any of the reports that are **from 2018** for one of the **"Windows" environments.**

        {% include lab-image.html image='hybrid-analysis-view-report.PNG' %}

    2.  Note the wide range of information that these reports provide about the
        executable.

        This malware makes a DNS request to one domain name. Examine the domain
        name that this malware attempts to access -- see the “Network Analysis”
        section (accessible via the menu on the right-hand side), and then the
        “Contacted Hosts” section. Keep this domain name in mind. The sandbox
        reports show that the domain name resolved to an IP addresses in the
        2018 reports, but not the 2017 one.

        {% include lab_question.html question='What IP address is associated with the domain name that WannaCry attempts to access in the 2018 reports?' %}

Now we will manually perform some of the analyses that hybrid-analysis performs,
in order to get a hands-on feel for the work involved.


# Static Analysis

Static Analysis is usually the first step in malware analysis. It involves
gathering as much information as possible from a potential malware file and
determining its functionality, purpose, and identifying traits to the greatest
degree possible. Static analysis does not involve running the malware file, and
thus is less risky than dynamic analysis. However, caution must be used here
(and in all stages of analysis), as certain analysis tools may execute the
malware without warning.


## Using the Strings Program

As its name implies, `strings` is a command-line tool that will parse through a
file and pull out any character strings in either ASCII or Unicode. The result
of running this tool can tell you many things about potential malware:

* Error messages can give telling information about the functionality of a program.
* IP addresses that the program will call to.
* Windows built-in library function files (DLLs) that the program will try to access.

`strings` is one of many programs provided by a set of tools originally
developed in 1996 which still rocks called
[sysinternals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/). It is already
installed on your windows virtual machine.

*   From a cmd prompt, confirm that you can run the program `strings`:

        strings

*   From a `cmd` prompt in the directory where
    `24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe` is
    located, run the following:

    ```bash
    strings -n 12 24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe > output.txt
    ```

*   Then, open output.txt with notepad:

    ```bash
    notepad output.txt        
    ```

    The `-n` option means “minimum string length.”

*   You may recognize this strings output from the hybrid-analysis report.

    Tips:
    * Use tab-completion to fill out the filename. Do not copy-paste. If you keep copy-pasting, I will turn all code-snippets on the
      website into screenshots to spite you.
    * A convenient shortcut to opening a Windows shell in a certain directory is to use Windows Explorer (the graphical file
      explorer thing) to navigate to where you want to go, then
      right-click in the white area in that directory listing, then choose "Open PowerShell window here". PowerShell can do everything a `cmd` prompt can do, and more.

*   From notepad, search through output.txt (use `ctrl+f`) for an "http://" url. This
    url is the "killswitch" domain which, when registered, blocked the wannacry
    spreader from
    [doing](https://www.wired.com/2017/05/accidental-kill-switch-slowed-fridays-massive-ransomware-attack/)
    its [thing](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/the-wannacry-sinkhole/). See
    [the comic on this page](https://web.archive.org/web/20181113122024/https://blog.comae.io/wannacry-new-variants-detected-b8908fefea7e)
    to understand in four simple comic panels the likely facepalm-reason why
    that functionality is even in the spreader in the first place.

    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the killswitch domain for this worm?' %}


## Resource Hacker

[Resource Hacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/) is another useful tool
that can often pull information from a malware sample without executing the
sample. Windows application development tools will set "resource" values that
are stored in the executables. Developers can customize these resource values.
Examining these executable resources can sometimes give insight into the
malware.

1.  Use Chocolately, the Windows package manager, to download and install
    Resource Hacker. Run the following from a windows `cmd` prompt:

    ```bash
    choco install -y reshack
    ```

1.  Open "Resource Hacker" by searching for it from the Windows search bar.
1.  Load the wannacry worm (`24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe`) into resource hacker.
1.  Navigate through the folder tree structure to see information about the
    malware.

    1.  Examine the "Version Info" node, and look at the "FileVersion". This can be
        helpful to track to note versions of malware that may be floating around.

        {% include lab_question.html question='What FileVersion does this malware claim to be?' %}

        Also, look at the CompanyName, FileDescription, and LegalCopyright.

        {% include lab_question.html question='What is the name of the company that this malware claims is its author?' %}

    1.  Applications can embed applications within their _resource_ section, which is accessible via
        the navbar on the left under the `R` tree. The loader stores the wannacry encryptor here. When the loader runs, if the killswitch is not triggered, it
        will extract the embedded resource payload, install it, and run it. Let's extract it manually and play with it.

        1.  Expand the "R" node, click on the star range, and then right-click
            it. Choose `Save Resources to a BIN file` (a BIN file is another
            name for a `.exe` in Windows). Save it where you like. _This is the
            wannacry encryptor_. <span class='label label-danger'>If you run
            this, your VM files will be encrypted.</span>
        2.  For convenience, rename it to `wannacry-payload.exe`.


## Strings again, this time on the wannacry encryptor

1.  From a cmd prompt in the directory where your newly extracted "wannacry-payload.exe" is located, run the following:

    ```bash
    strings -n 12 wannacry-payload.exe > output.txt
    notepad output.txt
    ```

    Read through the output.txt file and look for sensical strings. Some malware can use "packing" tricks to make it harder for malware analysts to perform static analysis (read more about it [here](https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/business/malware-packers-use-tricks-avoid-analysis-detection/)). "Packing" is a form of compressing that is sometimes also combined with encryption. If this malware
    were "packed", `strings` would find no sensical text inside. If it is _not_ packed, you will see English words which are names of Windows functions or custom that the malware may call internally.

    {% include lab_question.html question='Is this malware likely "packed", or is it "unpacked"?' %}

    <div class='alert alert-info'><strong>Consider.</strong> If you did not know what this malware did, what would seeing calls in the <code>strings</code> output to Windows functions such as
    "CryptDecrypt", "CryptEncrypt", "CryptDestroyKey", and "CryptImportKey" tell you? Dadgum right, got ransomware on our dadgum hands.</div>


## Analyzing DLLs with Dependency Walker

A few Dynamic Linked Library (dll -- the Windows function library) calls appeared when we ran the Strings program above. We can use another program, [Dependency Walker](http://www.dependencywalker.com/), to obtain more
information about those dlls and their use by the malware. Dynamic linking is an area that gives a great deal of insight into how a program functions, and it is of particular importance to malware analysis.

1.  Use the "choco" windows package manager to install Dependency Walker. From a cmd prompt:

    ```bash
    choco install -y dependencywalker
    ```

    Then, search for and run "Dependency Walker":

    {% include lab-image.html image='search-dependency-walker.png' %}

    When the program loads, use the "open" button on the top-left and load the wanncry.exe.

2.  There’s a lot of information here, so let’s step through it.
    *   The top-left pane shows all of the DLL files that are called by the
        WannaCry program.
    *   The top-right pane shows the functions that are called by the selected
        DLL.
    *   The right-middle pane shows all possible functions that could be called
        by the selected DLL, along with their ordinal values; a function can
        either be called by its name or by the ordinal value, so if you see an
        ordinal value called you can use this list to check its functionality.
        Calling functions by ordinal allows a program to call the function
        without ever using its name in the code.  It can be a useful obfuscation
        technique.
    *   The bottom two panes show additional information.

    Spend some time looking through the different DLLs.

    {% include lab_question.html question='Under ADVAPI32.DLL, find BCRYPT.DLL. What is function for ordinal value 37, i.e., the 37th function from the top?' %}

    <div class='alert alert-info'>Bcrypt.dll is a family of functions, documented and listed <a class='alert-link' href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/bcrypt/'>here</a>. Bcrypt.dll is not the same as the blowcrypt family of algorithms
    that we studied earlier in the semester. bcrypt.dll lamely refers to "bestcrypt", aka "Cryptography: Next Generation (CNG)" (see <a class='alert-link' href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9711568/does-winapis-bcrypt-h-actually-support-bcrypt-hashing">here</a>).
    It is the built-in Windows way to perform encryption. And yes, that means that Wannacry is lamely using Windows functions, instead of making their own functions, to encrypt.</div>


# Dynamic Analysis

Now we come to the fun part.

Dynamic Analysis is used to gather information about a file that could not be
gathered from static analysis. Dynamic Analysis is inherently riskier than
static analysis, as it involves investigating malware as it runs, or the state
of the host machine after the malware has executed. The drawbacks of dynamic
analysis are that:

1.  Malware may behave differently in a VM environment if the malware detects
    that it is in such a setting;
2.  Malware may behave differently depending on available network and Internet
    connections, and
3.  Running malware may potentially expose the host or other hosts on a network
    to risk, as mentioned previously.

But don't worry about number 3, you'll be fine as long as you do all of your work
on the Windows VM on Kali.


## Create a file

Use "notepad" to create a text document with any content, and save it on your
Windows VM desktop. This file will be encrypted by wannacry. For example, see
the following screenshot:

{% include lab-image.html image='r-click-desktop-new-txt.jpg' %}


## Process Monitor

You can get basic information from Task Manager in Windows, but Process Monitor
allows you to track every action of a given process.  Be warned that Process
Manager generates a lot of data, all of which it stores in RAM. So, it may
quickly fill up the memory of a VM and crash it if left to run for a long time.

No one in their right mind uses Process Monitor without applying some filters.
We will apply filters soon to the gigantic pile of data pouring in.

<div class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Final reminder!</strong> Make sure that you have a snapshot of your nice and un-ransomware'd vm before proceeding!</div>

1.  Launch Process Monitor by running command `procmon` from a cmd prompt:

    ```bash
    procmon
    ```

    Wait for Process Monitor to launch.


1.  With Process Monitor running, _run your 24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe_.

    OH NO, YOU ARE UNDER ATTACK.

    _Or are you?_
1.  Stop Process Monitor from collecting: (`File` > `Capture Events` to toggle, or click the button shown below:).

    {% include lab-image.html image='lab-malware-procmon-disable-capture.png' %}

1.  From within Process Monitor, launch the Process Tree (`Tools` > `Process
    Tree`, or click the button shown below):

    {% include lab-image.html image='lab-malware-procmon-launch-process-tree.png' %}

    Examine the Process Tree. Note the entry for
    `24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe`.
    Highlight it, then click `Include Process`. This will filter the events shown in the main process
    monitor view to only show associated with our malware
    worm's process id (PID).

    {% include lab-image.html image='lab-malware-include-process.png' %}

1.  In the icon menu on the top of Process Monitor, deselect all icons in the
    far-right section except for the icon third from the right.

    This will filter to show only network calls.  This should show at least one
    `TCP Connect` operation.

    {% include lab-image.html image='lab-procmon-select-network-events.png' %}

    This is the loader calling out to the killswitch domain. If the call
    resolves successfully, then the malware immediately exits without doing
    anything else.

    {% include lab_question.html question='What was the value of the "Result" field for any of <code>24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe</code>\'s "TCP Connect" events?' %}


## Disable Network Adapters and run the dropper again

The worm can't resolve the killswitch domain request, and therefore won't exit,
if the virtual machine doesn't have an internet connection!

Before we proceed, disable both of the VM's network adapters. To do this, from the VM's
"Details" menu, select both NICs, and for each, change the "Link State" to
"inactive." Once you have successfully done so, the Windows toolbar should show
a broken ethernet connection icon. This is desirable.

{% include lab-image.html image='lab-malware-disable-network-adapters.png' %}
{% include lab-image.html image='virt-manager-vm-no-ethernet-connection.PNG' %}

Open Process Monitor again. Do the following from the menu options:

*   Filter > Reset Filter
*   Edit > Clear display
*   File > Capture Events (to enable capturing)

1.  With Process Monitor running, right-click
    `24d004a104d4d54034dbcffc2a4b19a11f39008a575aa614ea04703480b1022c.exe` and
    choose "Run as Administrator."

    OH NO, YOU ARE UNDER ATTACK. YES, THIS TIME
    YOU REALLY ARE. TIME TO CRY.

    <div class='alert alert-info'><strong>Is running as administrator necesssary?</strong> Running as
    administrator is not strictly necessary for WannaCry to encrypt. But if it is not run as
    administrator, then in the next step, <code>tasksche.exe</code> gets dropped into a random, unpredictable location.</div>

1.  The dropper installed the file stored in its R resource section into the
    `C:\Windows\` directory, naming it `tasksche.exe`, and then ran it. This is
    the wannacry encryptor.

    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the sha256 hash of <code>C:\Windows\tasksche.exe</code>?' %}

1.  Well, what does this encryptor _do_?

    It scans through the entire drive for
    files with interesting file extensions, and it encrypts them, storing an
    encrypted version of the decryption key in header info in the file itself.
    The encrypted variants of all of your precious files have a `.WNCRY`
    extension.

    `strings` in `tasksche.exe` shows that it is looking for files with the following extensions:

    ```

    It then pops up an annoying notification about your ransomed state which
    will continue to pop up every sixty seconds or so. The best way to deal with
    that popup is _not_ to "X" it out, but rather, to drag it to a corner of
    your screen, almost out of sight.




    Open `notepad`, and using its "File" menu, open any of your encrypted files
    to examine its contents. (To find them, in the dropdown above
    "Open," change the filetype filter to "All Files")

    {% include lab-image.html image='notepad-all-files.png' %}

    What used to be plaintext now encrypted. The first 8 bytes of any
    file encrypted by wannacry are always the same. This is wannacry's "magic
    number." It's readable in ASCII, so you can see it in notepad.

    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the magic number for a wannacry-encrypted file?' %}

    **Note:** You can also examine files' magic numbers by using a hex examiner
    such as HxD. You can install HxD using chocolatey by running the following from a cmd prompt:

    ```bash
    choco install -y hxd
    ````


## Decrypting the WannaCrypted files

Just kidding. You can't.

Actually, you can with two long-shots.

1.  A decryption tool exists which can extract the prime numbers from memory
    which were used in the encryption.  However, [huge
    caveats](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2017/05/wannadecrypt-your-files/):
    it relies on a Windows encryption implementation bug that only works for
    Windows OS versions less than 10, (e.g., XP through 7), and "it relies on
    current running memory so once you reboot it will be gone and if you’ve done
    too much on the system since infection, it’s possible the key won’t be found
    (because it’s been overwritten by data from other applications using the
    same memory space)."

2.  Also, there's a chance that if you pay the ransom, you will get a
    response...
    [but](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3196880/security/paying-the-wannacry-ransom-will-probably-get-you-nothing-heres-why.html),
    "Those who do shouldn't expect a quick response -- or any response at all.
    Even after payment, the ransomware doesn’t automatically release your
    computer and decrypt your files, according to security researchers. Instead,
    victims have to wait and hope WannaCry’s developers will remotely free the
    hostage computer over the internet.  It's a process that’s entirely manual
    and contains a serious flaw: The hackers have no way to prove who paid off
    the ransom."

# Indictment

In September 2018, the US Justice Department [indicted a North Korean agent who
participated in the WannaCry and Sony
hacks](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/09/us-indicts-north-korean-agents-for-wannacry-sony-attacks/).
